# @codeverse/app

The spatial code explorer application.

## Status

⬡ **Planned** — Architecture design in progress

## Vision

A Three.js-powered spatial interface where:
- Code files are acetate sheets in 3D space
- Z-axis represents directory depth
- Color overlaps reveal architectural patterns
- Gestures replace clicks

Built on `@codeverse/csm-core`.
