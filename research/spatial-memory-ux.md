# Spatial Memory in UX — Research Notes

## Core Thesis
Humans navigate physical space using spatial memory — we remember
"where things are" rather than "what path leads there."

CSM applies this to software navigation:
- Files have *positions*, not paths
- "Login.tsx is the mid-left, blue-tinted sheet, second from front"
- Spatial recall > abstract path recall (C:/Users/src/components/Login.tsx)

## Open Questions
- What is the max number of layers before spatial memory degrades?
- Does color grammar generalize across languages/frameworks?
- Can the blur-depth metaphor transfer to AR headsets directly?
