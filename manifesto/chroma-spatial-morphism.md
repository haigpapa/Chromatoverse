# Chroma-Spatial Morphism (CSM)
## A Design Paradigm for the Spatial Computing Era

> We are entering the Post-Flat era of computing.

### The Three Pillars

**1. Z-Axis Prime Directive (Spatiality)**
Information is not hidden in folders. It is obscured by layers in front of it.
The back of the interface is not a blank wall — it is a deep void containing
the context of the entire system, visible but blurred.

**2. Subtractive Color Logic (Chroma)**
Color is utilitarian. Overlapping tinted sheets create new colors through
subtractive mixing. Color becomes functional syntax for filtering and state.

**3. Material Physics and Tactility (Morphism)**
The interface obeys a stylized physics engine. Sheets snap into focus with
satisfying tension. Edges catch and refract light. Digital objects have
premium, tangible presence.

### Codeverse Application

| Z-Layer | Meaning | Properties |
|---|---|---|
| Backmost | Root repository | blur: 16px, opacity: 0.4 |
| Mid-back | Directories | blur: 8px, opacity: 0.65 |
| Mid | Sub-directories | blur: 3px, opacity: 0.82 |
| Foreground | Active file | blur: 0, opacity: 1.0 |
| Pinned | Selected function | glint + snap + elevated |
