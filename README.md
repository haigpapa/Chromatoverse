# Codeverse
### *A Spatial Computing Interface for Software Architecture*

> **"This is not visualizing code. This is inhabiting code."**

Built on the **Chroma-Spatial Morphism (CSM)** design paradigm —
a post-flat interface philosophy that replaces file trees with depth,
search boxes with color algebra, and navigation clicks with physical gestures.
